# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

I care about the safety of myself, my loved ones, and others who operate automobiles daily.

What do you know about?

I know that the leading cause of death in the United States, aside from clinically-diagnosed medical conditions, is accidents/unintentional injuries, where automobile accidents amount to a massive portion of these deaths. Unintentional injuries accounted for 5.9% of U.S. deaths in 2018.

What decisions do you face?

Every day, I get in my car and drive to work, as does much of the United States. In my particular case, driving is the only option. For others, some people choose to take a train, subway, or other method of public transportation.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Yes. The data is broken down by 49 states, then by counties, cities, zip code, and streets...all the way to the street number that the accident occured on.

2. Trend related to the news

Yes. Automobile accidents are always in the news, as well as the resulting traffic of the accidents.

3. Who does that?

Yes. Many Americans commute to work daily in their automobiles.

4. Answering a question people care about

Yes. Finding specifics that lead to car accidents is something the public would most likely care about.

5. Valuable to businesses

Yes. To be honest, businesses may actually monetarily benefit more from car accidents than the alternative. They'll be sure to jack up insurance rates regardless of fault, declare your vehicle totaled, then fix it and sell it (or pay you a lesser value than it's really worth). Then there are medical expenses. In the unfortunate case that you pass away, the funeral home will also make it's fair share on your unfortunate event. However, this is valuable to everyone who operates a vehicle, including those who operate vehicles privately or on behalf of a business.

6. What's the most popular?

Yes. It would be particulary useful to understand the areas that most accidents occur and the commonalities between them: whether terrain type, weather conditions, road characteristics, etc.

7. Cost/Money rankings

Doesn't quite relate to the topic.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

I wouldn't call it a misconception, but I don't think most people realize how many car accidents occur in the United States -furthermore, the annual deaths resulting from these accidents.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Making explanatory visualizations for my data.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Yes.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Yes.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

Yes.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

This data is available on Kaggle.
